## What is bluelily?
[![](https://www.aschey.tech/tokei/github/Bamboooz/bluelily?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Bamboooz/bluelily)

bluelily is an advanced python library to manage GitHub repositories. It allows retrieving, user, repository information.
It also gives access to commiting, fetching, cloning, creating pull requests to your, and other users repositories.
(of course when interacting with other users repositories, you will need reviews as normal etc.)

## Installation
### You can install bluelily using pip:
```bash
pip install bluelily
```

## Usage
### Retrieving GitHub repository information

```python
import bluelily as bl

bl.log_actions = True  # log user interactions with GitHub

repo1 = bl.Repository("Bamboooz", "bluelily")

print (repo1.url)
# => https://github.com/Bamboooz/bluelily
print(repo1.stars)
# => 38 or something idk
print(repo1.branches)
# => [class Branch bla bla bla, ...]
print(repo1.branches[0].name)
# => "main"
```
